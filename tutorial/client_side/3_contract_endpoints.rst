The Contract Endpoints module
=============================

A more abstract connection to the PAB.
Follows design patterns we find generally useful.

Start
-----

To activate a contract instance that yields a transaction.
The yielded transaction is obtained by polling the PAB status.

Connect
-------

To activate a contract instance with no yield of transaction.


Do Operation
------------

To call and endpoint that yields a transaction.
The yielded transaction is obtained by polling the PAB status.
